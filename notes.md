## Your code will be reviewed for the following objectives:

 * Create an app with at least 3 activities that the user can navigate to. Build these activities out with designs, UI, and functionality as much as possible. Remember to validate form inputs. Use toasts and hide/show to communicate statuses to your user.

 * Display a list of information. Build this out as much as possible.

 * Gather user input and pass it to another activity.

 * Use ButterKnife to bind all views. Implement the View.OnClickListener interface to set click listeners to view elements.

 * Continue using good coding practices, especially indenting properly, commenting complex code segments, making logically separate Git commits, including a detailed README, and removing commented-out code and logging statements before committing.

 * Required functionality was present by the 5:00pm Friday deadline.

 * Project demonstrates understanding of this weekâ€™s concepts. If prompted, you can discuss your code with an instructor using correct terminology.
